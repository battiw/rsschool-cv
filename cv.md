### Briefly About Myself:

I have a technical mindset and acquired organizational skills intertwined with good communication skills. Over the past 10 years of work, the effective management and organization of the work of my department (up to 20 employees) allowed me to quickly bring it to a new level and increase efficiency.
The emphasis on self-development is clearly expressed. I have experience working with large volumes of analytical information. Ability to work independently, make decisions and purposefully achieve them.
After 21 years of successful work at the same place, I decided to try my hand at a new profession of a web developer, which is close to my interest. I understand the difficulties in mastering it, but I am confident in achieving this goal and I hope to get a long-term job.
I am married and have three dependent children. The property has real estate. I drive any vehicle.
